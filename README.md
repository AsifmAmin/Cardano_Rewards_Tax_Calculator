and for *Periode* you could choose for the year you want to calculate for. Then save this CSV file into the 
projects folder

2. run the python script, it is going to ask you to select your <a href="https://i.imgur.com/t9TOofh.png"> reward file</a>
which you got from pooltool.io, then it is going to ask you for the *ADA/USDT CSV file*.

3. Now it is going to ask you for
which currency you want it displayed as, you could choose between 166 currencies, you need to write the input as: ***USD, SEK, NOK, CAD*** etc

</a> 

4. Now you need to find how much your country tax for each reward, for instance in norway they tax 22% for each reward we get, 
so here i would write 0.22.
